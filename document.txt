THE OBJECTIVE OF THE APPLICATION
	We decided to use an apartment manager example for our database as it was a simple 
	idea and had tables in which CRUD operations would be applicable. We made this application 
	as an example for databases and as something that we thought one managing an apartment 
	system may be interested in, allowing them to store cities, buildings, rooms, tenants, 
	and finally the owners. 

EXPLAINATION OF THE DATABASE MODEL
	The database model we selected was simple. It had an overall database called “myDatabase” 
	and within had five unconnected tables. These tables were city, building, tenant, room, 
	and owner. Each table had fields and primary keys that we felt would be valuable to one 
	trying to manage the system. Each table and their fields are in the system as they are below:
	
	city
		cityName – Primary key
		province
		country
		
	building
		buildingName – Primary key
		cityName
		address
		postalCode
		numberRooms
		
	tenant
		tenantName – Primary key
		telNum
		age
		
	owner
		ownerName – Primary key
		buildingName
		
	room
		id – Primary key
		roomNum
		tenantName
		buildingName
		rent


STEPS WE DID TO DEPLOY TO THE CLOUD
	We followed the steps highlighted by the posted slideshow (Lecture 19). 
	We faced some issues when dealing with Amazon Web Services when trying to access the 
	localhost, however we added a rule into our instance to allow HTTP access and solved that 
	issue.
