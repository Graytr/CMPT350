THE OBJECTIVE OF THE APPLICATION
	When deciding what sort of databases we should do, we thought of many things from ones on games we both enjoyed to more generic examples. In the end we decided to use an apartment manager example for our database as it was a simple idea and had tables in which CRUD operations would be applicable. We made this application as an example for databases and as something that we thought one managing an apartment system may be interested in, allowing them to store cities, buildings, rooms, tenants, and finally the owners. 

EXPLAINATION OF THE DATABASE MODEL
	The database model we selected was simple. It had an overall database called “myDatabase” and within had five unconnected tables. These tables were city, building, tenant, room, and owner. Each table had fields and primary keys that we felt would be valuable to one trying to manage the system. Each table and their fields are in the system as they are below:
	city
		cityName – Primary key
		province
		country
	building
		buildingName – Primary key
		cityName
		address
		postalCode
		numberRooms
	tenant
		tenantName – Primary key
		telNum
		age
	owner
		ownerName – Primary key
		buildingName
	room
		id – Primary key
		roomNum
		tenantName
		buildingName
		rent

In our program however, we were able to get CRUD operations to work on all tables but owner and room. It tells us that the fields ‘ownerName’ and ‘roomNum’ could not be found in each of the respective tables. This lead us to much confusion as, as far as we can tell, the system should be working properly as the code for these two tables is very similar to those of the other tables.
